Often, the negative things in our life get much of our attention, while the positive things are harder to focus on and therefore harder to remember later on.</p><p>  <break time='2s'/> Before you leave, please take some time to fill in the survey on the tablet. </p><p>Once you’re done, let RESEARCHERNAME know by calling out to them.</p><p> RESEARCHERNAME will then enter the room to ask you a few questions before you leave. </p><p>Thank you for taking part in the four sessions about positive psychology exercises!
